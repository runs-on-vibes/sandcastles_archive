The author argues that while individual activists&rsquo; needs aren&rsquo;t perfectly aligned with maximum impact for animals, understanding and channeling ego can actually strengthen movements.</p><h2 id=the-unavoidable-ego>The Unavoidable Ego</h2><p>The author contends that completely setting aside ego is impossible.
