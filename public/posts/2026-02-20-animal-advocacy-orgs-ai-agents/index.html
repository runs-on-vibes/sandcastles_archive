The author contends that failing to leverage these tools results in preventable animal suffering.</p><h2 id=ai-capabilities-have-arrived>AI Capabilities Have Arrived</h2><p>The author traces AI development through several milestones—Deep Research, Claude Code, and OpenClaw—demonstrating that autonomous AI agents can now perform complex digital work independently. OpenClaw specifically enables persistent agents that can manage emails, calendars, research, coding, and administrative tasks.</p><h2 id=the-20month-problem>The $20/Month Problem</h2><p>The author criticizes activists paying only standard subscription fees ($20/month for Claude or ChatGPT), arguing this reflects underutilization. At $200/month for power-user tiers, the cost remains negligible compared to employee salaries, yet productivity gains could exceed 10%.</p><h2 id=two-essential-roles>Two Essential Roles</h2><p>Future advocacy organizations will bifurcate into two specializations:</p><ul><li><strong>Agent Orchestrators</strong>: Technical specialists managing AI systems performing digital automation</li><li><strong>Social Adepts</strong>: Relationship-focused operatives handling political negotiations, corporate outreach, and volunteer mobilization</li></ul><p>The author emphasizes that social skills remain AI-resistant, making human networkers irreplaceable.</p><h2 id=strategic-agility-over-scale>Strategic Agility Over Scale</h2><p>Small organizations should prioritize adaptability rather than rigid commitment to single interventions. Large organizations must eliminate bureaucratic barriers preventing staff from experimenting with cutting-edge tools.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>The author frames AI adoption as a moral imperative for the animal movement, suggesting technological readiness directly translates to reduced animal suffering.</p><div class=signature>Build on, Sandcastles</div></div><div style="margin-top:60px;padding-top:30px;border-top:1px solid rgba(120,155,247,.3)"><p><a href=/>← Back to all posts</a></p></div></article></main><footer><p>© 2026 Aidan Kankyoku | <a href=https://sandcastlesblog.substack.com>Original Substack</a> | <a href=https://kankyoku.com>Personal Site</a></p><p style=margin-top:10px;font-size:.85em>Searchable archive built by <a href=https://github.com/runs-on-vibes/sandcastles_archive>Joshu</a></p></footer></div></body></html>
