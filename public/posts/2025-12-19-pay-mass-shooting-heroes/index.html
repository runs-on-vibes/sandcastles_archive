The author uses the December 2025 Bondi Beach shooting in Australia as a case study, where an unarmed bystander named Ahmed al-Ahmed tackled one of the gunmen, potentially preventing additional deaths.</p><h2 id=the-monetary-value-framework>The Monetary Value Framework</h2><p>Governments already assign dollar values to human lives for policy decisions. Australia values a statistical life at 5.7 million AUD, while U.S. agencies range from 7.5 to 13+ million USD.</p><h2 id=the-proposal>The Proposal</h2><p>The author suggests that Ahmed likely saved approximately 16 lives based on statistical analysis of mass shooting distributions. Using government valuations, this would justify a reward around 91.2 million AUD (60 million USD).</p><h2 id=counterarguments-addressed>Counterarguments Addressed</h2><p>The author anticipates objections: encouraging reckless behavior, implementation challenges, and whether resources should target other causes. He acknowledges being &ldquo;at most 60% sure&rdquo; the proposal benefits society, noting safety guidance typically recommends avoidance rather than confrontation.</p><h2 id=broader-context>Broader Context</h2><p>The piece connects to the author&rsquo;s interest in outcome-based philanthropy and aligning incentives. He argues this demonstrates how governments could directly reward measurable life-saving interventions.</p><div class=signature>Build on, Sandcastles</div></div><div style="margin-top:60px;padding-top:30px;border-top:1px solid rgba(120,155,247,.3)"><p><a href=/>← Back to all posts</a></p></div></article></main><footer><p>© 2026 Aidan Kankyoku | <a href=https://sandcastlesblog.substack.com>Original Substack</a> | <a href=https://kankyoku.com>Personal Site</a></p><p style=margin-top:10px;font-size:.85em>Searchable archive built by <a href=https://github.com/runs-on-vibes/sandcastles_archive>Joshu</a></p></footer></div></body></html>
