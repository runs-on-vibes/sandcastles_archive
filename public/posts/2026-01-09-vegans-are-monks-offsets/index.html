We Need a Role for Laypeople.</h1><div class=post-date>January 9, 2026</div></header><div class=content><p>The article proposes that the animal advocacy movement should adopt a two-tiered structure modeled after religious institutions, where vegans function as a &ldquo;priestly class&rdquo; while non-vegans participate as supporters through donations and other low-commitment actions.</p><h2 id=the-veganism-plateau-problem>The Veganism Plateau Problem</h2><p>The author notes that despite three decades of vegan advocacy, veganism has stagnated at 1-4% globally. Meanwhile, meat consumption continues rising. This suggests that &ldquo;individual veganism appears to offer only limited potential&rdquo; for achieving animal liberation at scale.</p><h2 id=the-priesthood-model>The Priesthood Model</h2><p>Drawing parallels to Catholic and Buddhist traditions, the author argues that monks inspire admiration rather than resentment because laypeople support them without being expected to adopt identical lifestyles. He states: &ldquo;monks and laypeople exhibit a symbiotic relationship&rdquo; where &ldquo;the general public&mldr;takes comfort in the spiritual example set by the monks.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=offsets-as-entry-points>Offsets as Entry Points</h2><p>The author champions Farmkind&rsquo;s &ldquo;offset&rdquo; concept—where non-vegans donate to animal charities instead of changing diets. This approach offers:</p><ul><li>Scalable commitment matching personal conviction levels</li><li>Real measurable impact for animals</li><li>Historical precedent in alms-giving traditions</li></ul><h2 id=the-money-question>The Money Question</h2><p>The author argues that donations from wealthy non-vegans (like Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz) can generate more animal welfare improvements than expecting universal veganism. He contends: &ldquo;money can transform&mldr;almost anything anyone values.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=critical-points>Critical Points</h2><ol><li>Grassroots veganism remains valuable despite slow growth rates</li><li>Advocates shouldn&rsquo;t disparage vegans while recruiting omnivores</li><li>The movement risks alienating its activist base through anti-vegan messaging</li><li>Financial support should be celebrated, not viewed with moral suspicion</li></ol><p>The article ultimately advocates for respecting committed vegans while building a broader coalition of &ldquo;offsetters&rdquo; who support animal advocacy financially without dietary change.</p><div class=signature>Build on, Sandcastles</div></div><div style="margin-top:60px;padding-top:30px;border-top:1px solid rgba(120,155,247,.3)"><p><a href=/>← Back to all posts</a></p></div></article></main><footer><p>© 2026 Aidan Kankyoku | <a href=https://sandcastlesblog.substack.com>Original Substack</a> | <a href=https://kankyoku.com>Personal Site</a></p><p style=margin-top:10px;font-size:.85em>Searchable archive built by <a href=https://github.com/runs-on-vibes/sandcastles_archive>Joshu</a></p></footer></div></body></html>
