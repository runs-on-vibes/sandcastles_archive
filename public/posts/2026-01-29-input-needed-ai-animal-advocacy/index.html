The author identifies three major shifts that will reshape advocacy:</p><h2 id=funding-transformation>Funding Transformation</h2><p>The author contends that animal advocacy may soon transition from being funding-constrained (~$300 million annually) to capital-abundant. Anticipated IPOs of frontier AI companies like Anthropic could redirect substantial philanthropic resources toward animal welfare causes, creating what the author calls &ldquo;the largest transfer of wealth to rigorously altruistic people in human history.&rdquo;</p><p>However, this windfall presents challenges: organizations must ensure new funding maintains cost-effectiveness rather than enabling wasteful spending.</p><h2 id=labor-automation>Labor Automation</h2><p>AI will transform cognitive work, making previously labor-intensive strategies infinitely scalable. The author highlights diet-change advocacy as an example—once considered unscalable because human-led outreach couldn&rsquo;t keep pace with population growth. AI-powered vegan outreach agents could theoretically engage every person globally, shifting questions from &ldquo;can we?&rdquo; to &ldquo;should we?&rdquo;</p><h2 id=institutional-instability>Institutional Instability</h2><p>Traditional levers of change—corporate pressure campaigns and consumer demand—may become irrelevant if AI renders human labor economically worthless. The author argues that strategies requiring decade-long institutional negotiation won&rsquo;t survive transformative AI&rsquo;s arrival.</p><h2 id=strategic-call-to-action>Strategic Call to Action</h2><p>The author invites advocates to submit ideas addressing five categories:</p><ul><li>Leveraging AI for previously unaffordable strategies</li><li>Achieving quick, durable progress within 5-10 years</li><li>Priority research agendas</li><li>AI company relationship-building</li><li>Modernizing existing advocacy approaches</li></ul><p>The underlying thesis frames AGI arrival as an &ldquo;event horizon&rdquo;—a threshold beyond which current planning assumptions collapse.</p><div class=signature>Build on, Sandcastles</div></div><div style="margin-top:60px;padding-top:30px;border-top:1px solid rgba(120,155,247,.3)"><p><a href=/>← Back to all posts</a></p></div></article></main><footer><p>© 2026 Aidan Kankyoku | <a href=https://sandcastlesblog.substack.com>Original Substack</a> | <a href=https://kankyoku.com>Personal Site</a></p><p style=margin-top:10px;font-size:.85em>Searchable archive built by <a href=https://github.com/runs-on-vibes/sandcastles_archive>Joshu</a></p></footer></div></body></html>
