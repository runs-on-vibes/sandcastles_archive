This piece offers a shorter format with intentionally provocative predictions for 2026, framed as &ldquo;hot takes&rdquo; for the animal advocacy movement.</p><h2 id=hot-take-1-ai-acceleration>Hot Take #1: AI Acceleration</h2><p>The author predicts continued exponential progress in artificial intelligence throughout 2026, despite skeptics claiming the field has plateaued. Specific predictions include:</p><ul><li>The METR task-length chart will demonstrate a 4-5 month doubling time or faster for capability improvements</li><li>Visible impacts on U.S. employment, particularly in white-collar sectors</li><li>No significant market correction despite increasing economic dependence on AI investments</li></ul><h2 id=hot-take-2-cancel-culture-obsolescence>Hot Take #2: Cancel Culture Obsolescence</h2><p>The author argues that social ostracism as a corrective mechanism has become ineffective. The prediction asserts that attempted cancellations will fail because society has collectively rejected this approach. The author advocates reconnecting with previously ostracized individuals.</p><h2 id=hot-take-3-movement-unity>Hot Take #3: Movement Unity</h2><p>Internal factional disputes within animal advocacy—including grassroots versus professional approaches, welfarism versus abolitionism, and radical versus moderate tactics—will dissolve as practitioners recognize their interdependence. A unified &ldquo;Team Winning&rdquo; faction will emerge, prioritizing actual victories rather than ideological purity.</p><h2 id=call-to-action>Call to Action</h2><p>Readers are encouraged to: build AI automation skills, develop campaign expertise, abandon cancellation tactics, and pursue tangible animal advocacy victories across all tactical approaches.</p><div class=signature>Build on, Sandcastles</div></div><div style="margin-top:60px;padding-top:30px;border-top:1px solid rgba(120,155,247,.3)"><p><a href=/>← Back to all posts</a></p></div></article></main><footer><p>© 2026 Aidan Kankyoku | <a href=https://sandcastlesblog.substack.com>Original Substack</a> | <a href=https://kankyoku.com>Personal Site</a></p><p style=margin-top:10px;font-size:.85em>Searchable archive built by <a href=https://github.com/runs-on-vibes/sandcastles_archive>Joshu</a></p></footer></div></body></html>
