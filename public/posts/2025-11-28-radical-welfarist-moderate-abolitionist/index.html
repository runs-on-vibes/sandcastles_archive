The author contends that public indifference to farmed animals makes even modest welfare improvements narratively powerful, while campaigns for companion animals fail to shift attitudes toward factory farming.</p><h2 id=key-arguments>Key Arguments</h2><p><strong>The Categorization Problem</strong>
The author demonstrates that most people sort animals into fixed mental categories—pets, wild animals, vermin, and farmed animals—based on their relationship to humans rather than inherent moral worth. These categories don&rsquo;t easily transfer; campaigning against greyhound racing won&rsquo;t increase concern for chickens.</p><p><strong>Defining &ldquo;Radical&rdquo;</strong>
Drawing on sociologist Sidney Tarrow&rsquo;s work, the author introduces the &ldquo;Tarrow Line&rdquo;: there&rsquo;s an inverse relationship between how radical your cause appears and how radical your tactics should be. Shocking tactics work when the public already sympathizes with your message; more extreme causes require restraint.</p><p><strong>The Shrimp Welfare Backlash</strong>
The intense public ridicule following coverage of the Shrimp Welfare Project proved that &ldquo;extending even the smallest consideration to farmed animals triggers more fury than outright abolishing dog research or entertainment industries.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Timeline Matters</strong>
Strategic disagreements often stem from differing assumptions about how distant animal liberation is. Those believing change is imminent favor bolder demands, while those expecting centuries of progress prioritize incremental welfare improvements affecting billions of animals now.</p><h2 id=core-insight>Core Insight</h2><p>Welfare campaigns for factory-farmed species, particularly aquatic animals, represent the movement&rsquo;s most transgressive work because they challenge the fundamental public assumption that farmed animals deserve no moral consideration whatsoever.</p><div class=signature>Build on, Sandcastles</div></div><div style="margin-top:60px;padding-top:30px;border-top:1px solid rgba(120,155,247,.3)"><p><a href=/>← Back to all posts</a></p></div></article></main><footer><p>© 2026 Aidan Kankyoku | <a href=https://sandcastlesblog.substack.com>Original Substack</a> | <a href=https://kankyoku.com>Personal Site</a></p><p style=margin-top:10px;font-size:.85em>Searchable archive built by <a href=https://github.com/runs-on-vibes/sandcastles_archive>Joshu</a></p></footer></div></body></html>
