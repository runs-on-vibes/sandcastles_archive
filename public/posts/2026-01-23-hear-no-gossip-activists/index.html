The author argues that gossip functions as a demand-side problem—people spread rumors because others eagerly consume them—rather than a supply-side issue.</p><h2 id=the-psychology-of-belief>The Psychology of Belief</h2><p>Research demonstrates that humans automatically believe statements upon understanding them. As the author notes, &ldquo;the first story we hear anchors a narrative in our mind that&rsquo;s hard to revise.&rdquo; Even when corrections arrive later, initial impressions persist and distort subsequent judgments.</p><h2 id=perverse-incentives>Perverse Incentives</h2><p>Activist cultures inadvertently reward people for framing conflicts as abuse. This creates a &ldquo;race to the bottom&rdquo; where individuals rush to characterize themselves as victims before others do, distorting facts through selective framing.</p><h2 id=the-drama-triangle>The Drama Triangle</h2><p>Activists are particularly vulnerable to dramatizing conflicts because they genuinely combat real victimization. However, this instinct causes them to misapply abuse frameworks to ordinary disagreements between equals.</p><h2 id=reputation-as-virus>Reputation as Virus</h2><p>Rumors spread through networks with increasing distortion. The author illustrates this through a detailed account of how allegations against an organizer named Z became progressively more severe as the story circulated, eventually painting him as a &ldquo;serial rapist&rdquo; despite investigative evidence suggesting consensual encounters.</p><h2 id=practical-solutions>Practical Solutions</h2><p>The author proposes two testing questions before receiving gossip:</p><ol><li>Would all parties involved want the listener to hear it?</li><li>If not, is there legitimate justification?</li></ol><p>The author also distinguishes between healthy venting (with discrete, nonjudgmental listeners) and gossip intended to damage reputations. Reporting misconduct through organizational channels differs fundamentally from spreading rumors.</p><h2 id=key-mantras>Key Mantras</h2><ul><li>Gossip mirrors meat consumption—demand drives supply</li><li>Don&rsquo;t let others&rsquo; judgments replace your own thinking</li><li>True friends validate feelings without amplifying anger</li><li>Formal accountability processes are never gossip</li></ul><p>The essay concludes that breaking gossip cycles requires both individuals refusing to hear rumors and speakers reconsidering their intentions before sharing stories about others.</p><div class=signature>Build on, Sandcastles</div></div><div style="margin-top:60px;padding-top:30px;border-top:1px solid rgba(120,155,247,.3)"><p><a href=/>← Back to all posts</a></p></div></article></main><footer><p>© 2026 Aidan Kankyoku | <a href=https://sandcastlesblog.substack.com>Original Substack</a> | <a href=https://kankyoku.com>Personal Site</a></p><p style=margin-top:10px;font-size:.85em>Searchable archive built by <a href=https://github.com/runs-on-vibes/sandcastles_archive>Joshu</a></p></footer></div></body></html>
