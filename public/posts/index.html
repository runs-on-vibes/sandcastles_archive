This event launched the Battle of Brightlingsea—a ten-month sustained campaign that became &ldquo;the high-water mark of sustained, large-scale mobilization for farmed animals.&rdquo;</p><p>What made Brightlingsea remarkable wasn&rsquo;t the radical nature of its participants. A contemporary survey revealed that 71% were local residents, predominantly women aged 41-70, overwhelmingly meat-eaters. These weren&rsquo;t professional activists or vegans—they were ordinary people mobilized by a concrete, achievable demand.</p></div></li><li class=post-item><h2 class=post-title style=margin-bottom:8px><a href=/posts/2026-02-20-animal-advocacy-orgs-ai-agents/>You are letting animals die by missing out on AI productivity</a></h2><div class=post-meta style=margin-bottom:10px>February 20, 2026</div><div class=post-summary><h2 id=advice-for-animal-advocacy-orgs-and-job-seekers-in-the-age-of-agents>Advice for animal advocacy orgs and job seekers in the age of agents</h2><h3 id=in-this-post>In this post:</h3><ul><li><p><strong>AI agents have arrived,</strong> and animal advocacy organizations that don&rsquo;t adopt them immediately will fall behind– with animals bearing the cost.</p></li><li><p>Claude Code gives every activist the power of a software engineer; Claude Cowork extends it to all knowledge work. <strong>Every activist should be using Claude Cowork.</strong></p></li><li><p>Agents like OpenClaw cross a new threshold: full AI assistants that can access all your tools and don&rsquo;t wait for instructions. <strong>Organizations should rush to adopt agents as soon as security concerns are addressed.</strong></p></div></li><li class=post-item><h2 class=post-title style=margin-bottom:8px><a href=/posts/2026-01-29-input-needed-ai-animal-advocacy/>Input Needed: What Should Animal Advocates Do About AI?</a></h2><div class=post-meta style=margin-bottom:10px>January 29, 2026</div><div class=post-summary><p>Outdated assumptions</p><p>The design of the animal advocacy movement—the goals we are pursuing, the strategies we use to pursue them, and the division of people and money across those strategies—is built on a set of assumptions about the future which are no longer valid.</p><p>Subscribe below and I’ll invalidate even more of your assumptions at no cost to you.</p><p>Funding</p><p>The movement may no longer be funding-constrained at ~$300 million/year worldwide. Frontier AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic (makers of Claude) will likely go public in the next couple years. At current projections, this would cause the largest transfer of wealth to rigorously altruistic people in human history, thanks to cross-pollination between AI researchers and the EA community going back to the 2010s.</p></div></li><li class=post-item><h2 class=post-title style=margin-bottom:8px><a href=/posts/2026-01-23-hear-no-gossip-activists/>My New Year's Resolution: Hear No Gossip</a></h2><div class=post-meta style=margin-bottom:10px>January 23, 2026</div><div class=post-summary><h2 id=1-do-you-want-to-hear-something-juicy>1.

I DO WANT TO HEAR SOMETHING JUICY!</p><p>Gossip is an opportunity too good to pass up. Besides the delight of being let in on secrets and the gratification of hearing about other people’s dysfunctional lives, gossip is a powerful bonding mechanism, building a covenant between the person sharing the rumor and the person receiving it, not unlike the bond between two people who commit a crime together. It apparently played an important role in the evolution of our social brains.</p></div></li><li class=post-item><h2 class=post-title style=margin-bottom:8px><a href=/posts/2026-01-09-vegans-are-monks-offsets/>Vegans Are Monks, and Other Analogies to Environmental Activism</a></h2><div class=post-meta style=margin-bottom:10px>January 9, 2026</div><div class=post-summary><p>In this post:</p><p>With meat consumption skyrocketing and rates of veganism stagnant, strategies focused on individual veganism appear to offer only limited potential for animal advocates.</p><p>The small fraction who are vegan act as a symbolic vanguard, living out our vision for a world without animal exploitation.

This post brings readers from across the world up to speed on the best arguments from both sides, along with a related controversy from the year prior. In part 2, I share my own thoughts on “Forget Veganuary” and on the troubled relationship between animal welfare and veganism.</p><p>One of my most edgy and unique opinions about the animal rights movement is that Infighting Is Bad™. Whether it’s cancelling people for having the wrong political views or carving the movement up into illusory factions like welfarist vs. abolitionist or grassroots vs. professional, I think the movement wastes a lot of energy on pointless infighting.</p></div></li><li class=post-item><h2 class=post-title style=margin-bottom:8px><a href=/posts/2026-01-01-animal-activist-hot-takes-2026/>Animal Activist Hot Takes for 2026</a></h2><div class=post-meta style=margin-bottom:10px>January 1, 2026</div><div class=post-summary><p>I have heard from a few people who enjoy this newsletter.

Thanks to Joseph Ancion and Itsi Weinstock for thorough feedback.</p><h2 id=1-standing-at-the-precipice>1. Standing at the Precipice</h2><p>It is well-known among fans of true crime that the first 72 hours after someone goes missing are considered crucial for detectives; statistics suggest the chances of finding someone alive after that become vanishingly small.1 I remember watching a crime thriller about a kidnapping which leaned heavily on this fact: superimposed over the beginning of each scene, an ominous timer flashed the hours, minutes, and seconds since the victim had been reported missing. It was a great storytelling device, ratcheting up dramatic tension and creating a vivid feeling of a race against time.</p></div></li><li class=post-item><h2 class=post-title style=margin-bottom:8px><a href=/posts/2025-12-19-pay-mass-shooting-heroes/>We Should Pay Mass Shooting Heroes</a></h2><div class=post-meta style=margin-bottom:10px>December 19, 2025</div><div class=post-summary><p>I am highly uncertain about everything I argue in this post.</p><p>Did you know your government has determined the monetary value of a human life?</p><p>Many people feel squeamish about this upon learning about it for the first time. But this is an unavoidable reality for modern governments. States spend a lot of money trying to keep their citizens alive, often despite those citizens’ best efforts.</p><p>But states don’t have infinite resources, and they have other responsibilities besides life-saving, such as making sure nobody opens cute little businesses in areas zoned residential. In order to compare different life-saving interventions, the government has put a dollar amount on each life saved. Programs that come in under that dollar amount are, in theory, moved to the top of the funding queue.</p></div></li><li class=post-item><h2 class=post-title style=margin-bottom:8px><a href=/posts/2025-12-16-ego-is-ok-animal-activism/>Ego Is OK in Animal Activism</a></h2><div class=post-meta style=margin-bottom:10px>December 16, 2025</div><div class=post-summary><h2 id=1-ego-alignment>1. Ego alignment</h2><p>A few weeks ago, I shared this story about my friend Josh going undercover in a chicken slaughterhouse:</p><p>Between his broad, athletic build and gregarious personality, Josh tends to attract attention. So he was a bundle of nerves when he showed up the first day undercover, loaded up with 2005-era camera and microphone gear hidden under a thick jacket. It took all his attention to keep his hands from shaking as he stood outside in the early morning chill with the other workers; he already stood out like a sore thumb as the only one passing up the chance to smoke a cigarette.</p></div></li><li class=post-item><h2 class=post-title style=margin-bottom:8px><a href=/posts/2025-12-10-roots-of-welfarist-abolitionist-animal-rights/>The Roots of the Welfarist-Abolitionist Debate in Animal Rights</a></h2><div class=post-meta style=margin-bottom:10px>December 10, 2025</div><div class=post-summary><p>For at least ten years, the farmed animal advocacy movement has been persistently divided over cage-free campaigns. Cage-free acts as a Rorschach test; where half the movement sees the most successful animal advocacy strategy ever discovered, affecting more animals than all other animal rights campaigns combined, the other half sees a betrayal of the entire notion of animal rights and a strategic blunder setting the movement back decades.</p><p>When I first got involved, I was staunchly on the abolitionist side of this debate. Over time, I’ve become less certain. This essay (my shortest one yet!) presents a surprising argument for the origin of this debate. At least, I think you’ll agree it’s surprising, if I can convince you it holds any truth. Understanding this won’t immediately resolve the dispute, but it can help us stop talking past each other. It may have limited relevance outside Western countries, for reasons that will become clear shortly.</p></div></li><li class=post-item><h2 class=post-title style=margin-bottom:8px><a href=/posts/2025-12-04-activists-thinking-like-bureaucrats/>When Activists Start Thinking Like Bureaucrats</a></h2><div class=post-meta style=margin-bottom:10px>December 4, 2025</div><div class=post-summary><p>“[Moral authoritarianism] covers the surface of society with a network of small, complicated, minute, and uniform rules… it does not break wills, but it softens them, bends them and directs them… finally it reduces each nation to being nothing more than a flock of timid and industrious animals.” – Alexis de Tocqueville</p><p>Intro: Facing our demons</p><p>I don’t remember when I started identifying as a leftist. I grew up in a very liberal community. My first political awakening came when I was 13, during a televised debate for the 2008 Democratic presidential primary. Out of 8 candidates on the stage, I somehow developed a fixation with Barack Obama, maybe because he was the only one whose hair hadn’t already gone completely white. I wound up knocking on doors for Obama’s primary campaign, playing the cute “I can’t vote so you’ll have to do it for me” shtick.</p></div></li><li class=post-item><h2 class=post-title style=margin-bottom:8px><a href=/posts/2025-11-28-radical-welfarist-moderate-abolitionist/>The Radical Welfarists vs. the Moderate Abolitionists</a></h2><div class=post-meta style=margin-bottom:10px>November 28, 2025</div><div class=post-summary><p>This post was originally part of International Shrimpact Week, a competition between Substackers to raise matching funds for the Shrimp Welfare Project.

The case in point was protests by the International Council for Animal Welfare, who have staked out a niche by deploying radical tactics in favor of cage-free and other welfare campaigns, occupying corporate offices and shouting down customers at retail outlets.</p></div></li><li class=post-item><h2 class=post-title style=margin-bottom:8px><a href=/posts/2025-11-25-the-bitter-lesson-for-animal-activists/>The Bitter Lesson for Animal Activists</a></h2><div class=post-meta style=margin-bottom:10px>November 25, 2025</div><div class=post-summary><p><em>A new generation is revolutionizing the grassroots animal movement, by learning the same way superintelligent AI learns.</em></p><p>There are a lot of things about activism that I wish I had learned sooner.

Allen</em></p><p>Imagine you are leading a young, fast-growing grassroots activist organization. Your org is built around a community of activists, and mobilizing more activists is an important part of your strategy. After starting as an all-volunteer project, you got your first grant, which was enough to bring three co-founders (yourself included) on full time, each at $32k/year&ndash; barely over one half of the median full-time salary in the U.S. With your full attention, the organization has been thriving, attracting larger grants from new donors. The size of the paid team has tripled, and you&rsquo;ve increased the salary to a sustainable living wage of $55k. Between salaries and other expenses, you&rsquo;re hoping to raise a $1 million budget next year, a significant scale up. Historically, applying for philanthropic grants has been one of your many responsibilities, and up until now you&rsquo;ve raised almost all your money that way aside from a trickle that has come in organically through your website&rsquo;s &ldquo;donate&rdquo; button. But to scale up to $1 million, you&rsquo;re going to need to diversify.</p></div></li><li class=post-item><h2 class=post-title style=margin-bottom:8px><a href=/posts/2025-11-04-the-tsunami-is-coming/>The Tsunami is Coming</a></h2><div class=post-meta style=margin-bottom:10px>November 4, 2025</div><div class=post-summary><p>This post is meant to help animal advocates start thinking about how the artificial intelligence revolution will impact our work.
