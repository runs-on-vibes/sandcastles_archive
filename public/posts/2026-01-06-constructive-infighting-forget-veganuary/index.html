The forgetveganuary.com site featured a calculator determining monthly giving amounts to effective animal charities.</p><p><strong>Key Arguments Supporting the Approach:</strong></p><ul><li>Targets audiences resistant to veganism messaging</li><li>Research suggests meat-eaters find donations less difficult than diet change</li><li>Leverages trusted messengers (competitive eaters) to reach entrenched consumers</li><li>Generates mainstream media coverage for animal cause</li></ul><p><strong>Primary Criticisms:</strong></p><ul><li>Undermines veganism&rsquo;s role as a costly signal binding the movement</li><li>May discourage rather than encourage dietary reduction</li><li>Lacks evidence that offsetting won&rsquo;t become excuse for continued consumption</li><li>Potentially misleading positioning as &ldquo;cooperative&rdquo; while explicitly attacking veganism</li></ul><p><strong>Notable Finding:</strong> The campaign was strategically designed with Veganuary&rsquo;s knowledge, creating coordinated media attention rather than genuine conflict.</p><h2 id=case-2-animal-rising-vs-rspca>Case 2: Animal Rising vs. RSPCA</h2><p>Animal Rising campaigned against the RSPCA&rsquo;s &ldquo;Assured&rdquo; welfare certification for factory farms, arguing it legitimizes industrial animal agriculture through the UK&rsquo;s most trusted animal organization.</p><p><strong>Welfare Argument:</strong>
