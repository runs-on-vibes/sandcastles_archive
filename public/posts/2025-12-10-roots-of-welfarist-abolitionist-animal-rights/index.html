The author argues that the prioritization of freedom over welfare—central to abolitionist opposition to cage-free campaigns—originates from Milton&rsquo;s theological solution to the problem of evil, which then influenced liberal political philosophy through thinkers like John Locke.</p><h2 id=the-theological-foundation>The Theological Foundation</h2><p>Milton&rsquo;s God permits human suffering because freedom is more valuable than safety. As the author explains, God justifies creating humans destined for damnation by asserting: &ldquo;I made him just and right, Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=cultural-inheritance>Cultural Inheritance</h2><p>The author demonstrates that Protestant cultures—particularly Anglophone societies—disproportionately prioritize liberty over security compared to non-Protestant societies. Survey data shows countries shaped by Confucianism, Catholicism, or Orthodoxy explicitly choose &ldquo;order&rdquo; and &ldquo;security&rdquo; over &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; and &ldquo;self-expression.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=the-animal-activism-connection>The Animal Activism Connection</h2><p>The abolitionist resistance to welfare reforms like cage-free campaigns mirrors this theological preference. The author notes many abolitionists unconsciously inherited this value hierarchy while shedding the religious framework that created it.</p><h2 id=the-reframing>The Reframing</h2><p>Crucially, the author argues this is a <strong>false dichotomy</strong>. Cage-free farming offers animals more freedom <em>and</em> more welfare—not a tradeoff between them. Different chickens occupy each system; no individual experiences transition from caged to free. The actual choice is between &ldquo;more of both or less of both.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Key statement:</strong> &ldquo;Cage-free isn&rsquo;t a choice between freedom and welfare. It is a choice between more of both or less of both.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>The author, formerly abolitionist herself, contends that cage-free campaigns represent &ldquo;the greatest harm reduction in human history&rdquo; and should strengthen, not undermine, confidence in achieving further progress.</p><div class=signature>Build on, Sandcastles</div></div><div style="margin-top:60px;padding-top:30px;border-top:1px solid rgba(120,155,247,.3)"><p><a href=/>← Back to all posts</a></p></div></article></main><footer><p>© 2026 Aidan Kankyoku | <a href=https://sandcastlesblog.substack.com>Original Substack</a> | <a href=https://kankyoku.com>Personal Site</a></p><p style=margin-top:10px;font-size:.85em>Searchable archive built by <a href=https://github.com/runs-on-vibes/sandcastles_archive>Joshu</a></p></footer></div></body></html>
