This piece argues that the animal advocacy movement's strategic assumptions have become outdated due to imminent artificial general intelligence (AGI) development. The author identifies three major shifts that will reshape advocacy:

## Funding Transformation

The author contends that animal advocacy may soon transition from being funding-constrained (~$300 million annually) to capital-abundant. Anticipated IPOs of frontier AI companies like Anthropic could redirect substantial philanthropic resources toward animal welfare causes, creating what the author calls "the largest transfer of wealth to rigorously altruistic people in human history."

However, this windfall presents challenges: organizations must ensure new funding maintains cost-effectiveness rather than enabling wasteful spending.

## Labor Automation

AI will transform cognitive work, making previously labor-intensive strategies infinitely scalable. The author highlights diet-change advocacy as an example—once considered unscalable because human-led outreach couldn't keep pace with population growth. AI-powered vegan outreach agents could theoretically engage every person globally, shifting questions from "can we?" to "should we?"

## Institutional Instability

Traditional levers of change—corporate pressure campaigns and consumer demand—may become irrelevant if AI renders human labor economically worthless. The author argues that strategies requiring decade-long institutional negotiation won't survive transformative AI's arrival.

## Strategic Call to Action

The author invites advocates to submit ideas addressing five categories:
- Leveraging AI for previously unaffordable strategies
- Achieving quick, durable progress within 5-10 years
- Priority research agendas
- AI company relationship-building
- Modernizing existing advocacy approaches

The underlying thesis frames AGI arrival as an "event horizon"—a threshold beyond which current planning assumptions collapse.
