The author acknowledges feedback from readers who find lengthy weekly posts challenging. This piece offers a shorter format with intentionally provocative predictions for 2026, framed as "hot takes" for the animal advocacy movement.

## Hot Take #1: AI Acceleration

The author predicts continued exponential progress in artificial intelligence throughout 2026, despite skeptics claiming the field has plateaued. Specific predictions include:

- The METR task-length chart will demonstrate a 4-5 month doubling time or faster for capability improvements
- Visible impacts on U.S. employment, particularly in white-collar sectors
- No significant market correction despite increasing economic dependence on AI investments

## Hot Take #2: Cancel Culture Obsolescence

The author argues that social ostracism as a corrective mechanism has become ineffective. The prediction asserts that attempted cancellations will fail because society has collectively rejected this approach. The author advocates reconnecting with previously ostracized individuals.

## Hot Take #3: Movement Unity

Internal factional disputes within animal advocacy—including grassroots versus professional approaches, welfarism versus abolitionism, and radical versus moderate tactics—will dissolve as practitioners recognize their interdependence. A unified "Team Winning" faction will emerge, prioritizing actual victories rather than ideological purity.

## Call to Action

Readers are encouraged to: build AI automation skills, develop campaign expertise, abandon cancellation tactics, and pursue tangible animal advocacy victories across all tactical approaches.
