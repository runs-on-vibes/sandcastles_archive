The article proposes that governments should financially reward civilians who successfully stop mass shootings. The author uses the December 2025 Bondi Beach shooting in Australia as a case study, where an unarmed bystander named Ahmed al-Ahmed tackled one of the gunmen, potentially preventing additional deaths.

## The Monetary Value Framework

Governments already assign dollar values to human lives for policy decisions. Australia values a statistical life at 5.7 million AUD, while U.S. agencies range from 7.5 to 13+ million USD.

## The Proposal

The author suggests that Ahmed likely saved approximately 16 lives based on statistical analysis of mass shooting distributions. Using government valuations, this would justify a reward around 91.2 million AUD (60 million USD).

## Counterarguments Addressed

The author anticipates objections: encouraging reckless behavior, implementation challenges, and whether resources should target other causes. He acknowledges being "at most 60% sure" the proposal benefits society, noting safety guidance typically recommends avoidance rather than confrontation.

## Broader Context

The piece connects to the author's interest in outcome-based philanthropy and aligning incentives. He argues this demonstrates how governments could directly reward measurable life-saving interventions.
