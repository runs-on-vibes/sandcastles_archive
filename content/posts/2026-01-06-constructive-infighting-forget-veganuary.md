This article examines two strategic disagreements within the animal advocacy movement that exemplified productive conflict: Farmkind's "Forget Veganuary" campaign and Animal Rising's challenge to the RSPCA's welfare certification scheme.

## Case 1: Farmkind's Offsetting Strategy

In late December 2025, former Veganuary advocate Toni Vernilli launched a campaign suggesting meat-eaters could offset their consumption through donations rather than dietary change. The forgetveganuary.com site featured a calculator determining monthly giving amounts to effective animal charities.

**Key Arguments Supporting the Approach:**
- Targets audiences resistant to veganism messaging
- Research suggests meat-eaters find donations less difficult than diet change
- Leverages trusted messengers (competitive eaters) to reach entrenched consumers
- Generates mainstream media coverage for animal cause

**Primary Criticisms:**
- Undermines veganism's role as a costly signal binding the movement
- May discourage rather than encourage dietary reduction
- Lacks evidence that offsetting won't become excuse for continued consumption
- Potentially misleading positioning as "cooperative" while explicitly attacking veganism

**Notable Finding:** The campaign was strategically designed with Veganuary's knowledge, creating coordinated media attention rather than genuine conflict.

## Case 2: Animal Rising vs. RSPCA

Animal Rising campaigned against the RSPCA's "Assured" welfare certification for factory farms, arguing it legitimizes industrial animal agriculture through the UK's most trusted animal organization.

**Welfare Argument:**
Animal Rising's investigations documented repeated standard violations on certified farms, though some improvements exist compared to uncertified operations.

**Strategic Trade-offs:**
- RSPCA Assured prevents worst practices (battery cages, gestation crates)
- Certification might increase consumption by providing moral permission
- Removing the scheme could transfer farms to weaker Red Tractor standards
- Campaign successfully pressured stronger enforcement mechanisms

## Shared Lessons

Both controversies demonstrated that productive movement disagreement requires:

1. **Substantive engagement** rather than dismissal
2. **Clear evidence gathering** about actual impacts
3. **Maintaining relationships** despite public criticism
4. **Acknowledging measurement challenges** in social advocacy

The author argues these conflicts strengthen rather than weaken animal advocacy by forcing rigorous examination of assumptions underlying different strategies.
