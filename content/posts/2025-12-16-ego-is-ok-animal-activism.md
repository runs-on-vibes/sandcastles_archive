This essay explores the tension between personal ego and effective animal activism. The author argues that while individual activists' needs aren't perfectly aligned with maximum impact for animals, understanding and channeling ego can actually strengthen movements.

## The Unavoidable Ego

The author contends that completely setting aside ego is impossible. Instead, activists should recognize their psychological drives—ambition, desire for recognition, intellectual challenge—and learn to align them with movement goals. As he explains, "your personal needs are, by default, not perfectly aligned to the goal of creating as much change for animals as possible."

## The Enneagram Framework

Using the Enneagram personality system, the author identifies nine motivations (numbered 1-9), noting that the drive to "be a good person" (#1) is particularly dangerous because it can prioritize moral purity over actual impact.

## Micromanagement from Below

The essay criticizes activists without formal leadership roles who attempt to control decisions disproportionate to their contributions. The author recounts receiving difficult feedback from Wayne Hsiung at Direct Action Everywhere, learning that respecting organizational hierarchy actually enables better outcomes.

## Diversity of Approaches

The author concludes that successful movements require thousands pursuing different strategies simultaneously, not everyone optimizing for a single "most effective" approach.
