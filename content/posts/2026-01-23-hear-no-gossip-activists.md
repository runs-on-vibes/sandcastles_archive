This comprehensive essay examines how gossip undermines activist communities and proposes strategies to reduce its harmful effects. The author argues that gossip functions as a demand-side problem—people spread rumors because others eagerly consume them—rather than a supply-side issue.

## The Psychology of Belief

Research demonstrates that humans automatically believe statements upon understanding them. As the author notes, "the first story we hear anchors a narrative in our mind that's hard to revise." Even when corrections arrive later, initial impressions persist and distort subsequent judgments.

## Perverse Incentives

Activist cultures inadvertently reward people for framing conflicts as abuse. This creates a "race to the bottom" where individuals rush to characterize themselves as victims before others do, distorting facts through selective framing.

## The Drama Triangle

Activists are particularly vulnerable to dramatizing conflicts because they genuinely combat real victimization. However, this instinct causes them to misapply abuse frameworks to ordinary disagreements between equals.

## Reputation as Virus

Rumors spread through networks with increasing distortion. The author illustrates this through a detailed account of how allegations against an organizer named Z became progressively more severe as the story circulated, eventually painting him as a "serial rapist" despite investigative evidence suggesting consensual encounters.

## Practical Solutions

The author proposes two testing questions before receiving gossip:

1. Would all parties involved want the listener to hear it?
2. If not, is there legitimate justification?

The author also distinguishes between healthy venting (with discrete, nonjudgmental listeners) and gossip intended to damage reputations. Reporting misconduct through organizational channels differs fundamentally from spreading rumors.

## Key Mantras

- Gossip mirrors meat consumption—demand drives supply
- Don't let others' judgments replace your own thinking
- True friends validate feelings without amplifying anger
- Formal accountability processes are never gossip

The essay concludes that breaking gossip cycles requires both individuals refusing to hear rumors and speakers reconsidering their intentions before sharing stories about others.
