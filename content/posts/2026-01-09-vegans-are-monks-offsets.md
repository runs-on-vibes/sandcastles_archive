The article proposes that the animal advocacy movement should adopt a two-tiered structure modeled after religious institutions, where vegans function as a "priestly class" while non-vegans participate as supporters through donations and other low-commitment actions.

## The Veganism Plateau Problem

The author notes that despite three decades of vegan advocacy, veganism has stagnated at 1-4% globally. Meanwhile, meat consumption continues rising. This suggests that "individual veganism appears to offer only limited potential" for achieving animal liberation at scale.

## The Priesthood Model

Drawing parallels to Catholic and Buddhist traditions, the author argues that monks inspire admiration rather than resentment because laypeople support them without being expected to adopt identical lifestyles. He states: "monks and laypeople exhibit a symbiotic relationship" where "the general public...takes comfort in the spiritual example set by the monks."

## Offsets as Entry Points

The author champions Farmkind's "offset" concept—where non-vegans donate to animal charities instead of changing diets. This approach offers:
- Scalable commitment matching personal conviction levels
- Real measurable impact for animals
- Historical precedent in alms-giving traditions

## The Money Question

The author argues that donations from wealthy non-vegans (like Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz) can generate more animal welfare improvements than expecting universal veganism. He contends: "money can transform...almost anything anyone values."

## Critical Points

1. Grassroots veganism remains valuable despite slow growth rates
2. Advocates shouldn't disparage vegans while recruiting omnivores
3. The movement risks alienating its activist base through anti-vegan messaging
4. Financial support should be celebrated, not viewed with moral suspicion

The article ultimately advocates for respecting committed vegans while building a broader coalition of "offsetters" who support animal advocacy financially without dietary change.
