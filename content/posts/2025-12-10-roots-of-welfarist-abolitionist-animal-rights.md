This essay traces the philosophical roots of the abolitionist versus welfarist divide in animal advocacy back to John Milton's *Paradise Lost* and Protestant theology. The author argues that the prioritization of freedom over welfare—central to abolitionist opposition to cage-free campaigns—originates from Milton's theological solution to the problem of evil, which then influenced liberal political philosophy through thinkers like John Locke.

## The Theological Foundation

Milton's God permits human suffering because freedom is more valuable than safety. As the author explains, God justifies creating humans destined for damnation by asserting: "I made him just and right, Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall."

## Cultural Inheritance

The author demonstrates that Protestant cultures—particularly Anglophone societies—disproportionately prioritize liberty over security compared to non-Protestant societies. Survey data shows countries shaped by Confucianism, Catholicism, or Orthodoxy explicitly choose "order" and "security" over "freedom" and "self-expression."

## The Animal Activism Connection

The abolitionist resistance to welfare reforms like cage-free campaigns mirrors this theological preference. The author notes many abolitionists unconsciously inherited this value hierarchy while shedding the religious framework that created it.

## The Reframing

Crucially, the author argues this is a **false dichotomy**. Cage-free farming offers animals more freedom *and* more welfare—not a tradeoff between them. Different chickens occupy each system; no individual experiences transition from caged to free. The actual choice is between "more of both or less of both."

**Key statement:** "Cage-free isn't a choice between freedom and welfare. It is a choice between more of both or less of both."

## Conclusion

The author, formerly abolitionist herself, contends that cage-free campaigns represent "the greatest harm reduction in human history" and should strengthen, not undermine, confidence in achieving further progress.
