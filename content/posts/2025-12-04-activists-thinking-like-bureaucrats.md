This essay argues that progressive activists have developed an authoritarian streak that manifests through excessive rulemaking at both governmental and interpersonal levels. The author traces this tendency from formal regulations (like NEPA environmental rules) to informal social policing within activist communities.

## Key Arguments

**The Core Problem:** Inside every activist are two competing forces—the "rigid radical" who obsesses over perfection and the "joyful militant" who finds meaning in imperfect progress. When rigid radicalism dominates, it creates self-defeating regulations and toxic community dynamics.

**Regulatory Backfire:** Environmental regulations intended to protect nature have paradoxically slowed renewable energy deployment. Solar and wind projects face higher rejection rates under NEPA than fossil fuel projects, effectively favoring the industries environmentalists oppose.

**The Nonprofit Problem:** Complex regulations spawn bureaucratic infrastructure where organizations become self-perpetuating. Environmental groups now litigate against solar farms, having evolved incentive structures disconnected from their stated missions.

**Social Suffocation:** Excessive rules—from zoning restrictions to invisible community norms—strangle human creativity. Housing costs skyrocket, affordable restaurants disappear, and small businesses cannot launch because compliance burdens exceed their financial capacity.

**Psychological Roots:** Rigid radicalism stems from perfectionism, unconscious power-seeking disguised as justice work, and self-hatred. The author describes participating in organizational sabotage driven by these impulses, later recognizing how activist identity can mask domination attempts.

## Conclusion

The author advocates for animal advocates to reject regulatory perfectionism, instead positioning themselves as advocates for freedom—establishing "the most minimal moral boundary" against animal slaughter while defending broad personal liberty elsewhere.
