title: "The End of Animal Advocacy"

The author argues that transformative AI development presents an unprecedented but rapidly closing window of opportunity for animal advocates. He estimates 5-10 years remain before AI fundamentally reshapes society, leaving activists with roughly 260 weeks to act strategically.

## Core Argument

The author contends that "what may turn out to be the greatest window of opportunity for animal advocacy in human history is starting to close." Unlike previous social movements, animal advocates now face concrete timelines measured in years rather than decades, forcing a complete reassessment of movement strategy.

## Ten Futures Framework

The author outlines ten plausible AI-influenced scenarios with distinct implications for animal advocacy:

1. **Commoditized Intelligence** - Competition drives AI costs down; energy becomes scarce; cultivated meat development should focus on China's manufacturing infrastructure

2. **Gradual Handoff** - An aligned AI steward manages society; advocates should pursue visible cultural shifts now to influence permanently locked-in values

3. **Great Power Showdown** - US-China competition overshadows activism; positioning alt protein as a national security priority becomes critical

4. **AI-Enabled Coup** - Single actor seizes total control; cultivating relationships with influential AI researchers becomes essential

5. **Gradual Disempowerment** - Humans become economically irrelevant; land competition favors plant-based systems by default

6. **Industrial Collapse** - Catastrophic conflict reduces civilization; preserving knowledge about ethical protein production ensures better rebuilding

7. **Democratic AI** - Technology handles management while democracy shapes values; traditional advocacy methods remain viable

8. **Digital Rights Movement** - Sentient machines force moral circle expansion; framing matters significantly for animals' inclusion

9-10. **[Content truncated in source material]**

## Strategic Implications

The author emphasizes that preparation depends entirely on which scenario materializes. Rather than pursue parallel strategies, he proposes animal advocates should "divide into ten teams" mentally committing to different futures to ensure readiness regardless of outcomes.

The overarching message: the next five years may determine animal liberation's feasibility for centuries, demanding immediate strategic recalibration rather than incremental progress.
